@desc:
Given an array nums with n integers, your task is to check if it could become non-decreasing by modifying at most one element.

We define an array is non-decreasing if nums[i] <= nums[i + 1] holds for every i (0-based) such that (0 <= i <= n - 2).



Example 1:

Input: nums = [4,2,3]
Output: true
Explanation: You could modify the first 4 to 1 to get a non-decreasing array.
Example 2:

Input: nums = [4,2,1]
Output: false
Explanation: You can't get a non-decreasing array by modify at most one element.


Constraints:

n == nums.length
1 <= n <= 104
-105 <= nums[i] <= 105

                    nums[i - 1] = nums[i]
                else:
                    nums[i] = nums[i - 1]
        return count <= 1
