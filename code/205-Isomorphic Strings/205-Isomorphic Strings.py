# Given two strings s and t, determine if they are isomorphic.
# Two strings are isomorphic if the characters in s can be replaced to get t.
# All occurrences of a character must be replaced with another character while preserving the order of characters. No two characters may map to the same character but a character may map to itself.
#
# Example 1:
# Input: s = "egg", t = "add"
# Output: true
#
# Example 2:
# Input: s = "foo", t = "bar"
# Output: false
#
# Example 3:
# Input: s = "paper", t = "title"
# Output: true
#
# Note:
# You may assume both s and t have the same length.
