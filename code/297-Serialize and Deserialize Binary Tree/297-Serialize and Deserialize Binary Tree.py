解题步骤（自动整理）
1. 定义状态（dp[i] 或 dp[i][j]）来表示子问题的最优解/可行性
2. 写出状态转移方程，并处理边界初始化
3. 按依赖顺序递推（必要时滚动数组优化空间），得到最终答案

@desc:
Serialization is the process of converting a data structure or object into a sequence of bits so that it can be stored in a file or memory buffer, or transmitted across a network connection link to be reconstructed later in the same or another computer environment.

Design an algorithm to serialize and deserialize a binary tree. There is no restriction on how your serialization/deserialization algorithm should work. You just need to ensure that a binary tree can be serialized to a string and this string can be deserialized to the original tree structure.

Clarification: The input/output format is the same as how LeetCode serializes a binary tree. You do not necessarily need to follow this format, so please be creative and come up with different approaches yourself.



Example 1:


Input: root = [1,2,3,null,null,4,5]
Output: [1,2,3,null,null,4,5]
Example 2:

Input: root = []
Output: []
Example 3:

Input: root = [1]
Output: [1]
Example 4:

Input: root = [1,2]
Output: [1,2]


Constraints:

The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [0, 104].
-1000 <= Node.val <= 1000
