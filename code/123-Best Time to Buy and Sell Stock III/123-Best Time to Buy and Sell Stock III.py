@file: 123-Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock III.py
@time: 2021/1/9 5:25 下午
@desc:

Say you have an array for which the ith element is the price of a given stock on day i.

Design an algorithm to find the maximum profit. You may complete at most two transactions.

Note: You may not engage in multiple transactions at the same time (i.e., you must sell the stock before you buy again).



Example 1:

Input: prices = [3,3,5,0,0,3,1,4]
Output: 6
Explanation: Buy on day 4 (price = 0) and sell on day 6 (price = 3), profit = 3-0 = 3.
Then buy on day 7 (price = 1) and sell on day 8 (price = 4), profit = 4-1 = 3.
Example 2:

Input: prices = [1,2,3,4,5]
Output: 4
Explanation: Buy on day 1 (price = 1) and sell on day 5 (price = 5), profit = 5-1 = 4.
Note that you cannot buy on day 1, buy on day 2 and sell them later, as you are engaging multiple transactions at the same time. You must sell before buying again.
Example 3:

Input: prices = [7,6,4,3,1]
Output: 0
Explanation: In this case, no transaction is done, i.e. max profit = 0.
Example 4:

Input: prices = [1]
Output: 0


Constraints:

1 <= prices.length <= 105
0 <= prices[i] <= 105


buy1, buy2 ,sell1, sell2

buy1 = max(buy1`, -price[i])
sell1 = max(sell1`, buy1` + price[i])

buy2 = max(buy2`, sell1` - price[i])
sell2 = max(sell2`, buy2` + price[i])
