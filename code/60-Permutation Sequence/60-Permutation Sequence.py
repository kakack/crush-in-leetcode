@desc:
The set [1,2,3,...,n] contains a total of n! unique permutations.

By listing and labeling all of the permutations in order, we get the following sequence for n = 3:

"123"
"132"
"213"
"231"
"312"
"321"
Given n and k, return the kth permutation sequence.

Note:

Given n will be between 1 and 9 inclusive.
Given k will be between 1 and n! inclusive.
Example 1:

Input: n = 3, k = 3
Output: "213"
Example 2:

Input: n = 4, k = 9
Output: "2314"
