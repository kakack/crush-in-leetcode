# There are n servers numbered from 0 to n - 1 connected by undirected server-to-server connections forming a network where connections[i] = [ai, bi] represents a connection between servers ai and bi. Any server can reach other servers directly or indirectly through the network.

# A critical connection is a connection that, if removed, will make some servers unable to reach some other server.

# Return all critical connections in the network in any order.

 

# Example 1:


# Input: n = 4, connections = [[0,1],[1,2],[2,0],[1,3]]
# Output: [[1,3]]
# Explanation: [[3,1]] is also accepted.
# Example 2:

# Input: n = 2, connections = [[0,1]]
# Output: [[0,1]]
 

# Constraints:

# 2 <= n <= 10^5
# n - 1 <= connections.length <= 10^5
# 0 <= ai, bi <= n - 1
# ai != bi
# There are no repeated connections.
