LeetCode 406 - Queue Reconstruction by Height

解题步骤（自动整理）
1. 将起点/初始层入队，并用 visited 或原地标记避免重复访问
2. 按层或按队列弹出元素扩展相邻节点，满足条件时更新答案
3. 队列处理完毕后返回结果（或在首次到达目标时提前返回）

// You are given an array of people, people, which are the attributes of some people in a queue (not necessarily in order). Each people[i] = [hi, ki] represents the ith person of height hi with exactly ki other people in front who have a height greater than or equal to hi.

// Reconstruct and return the queue that is represented by the input array people. The returned queue should be formatted as an array queue, where queue[j] = [hj, kj] is the attributes of the jth person in the queue (queue[0] is the person at the front of the queue).



// Example 1:

// Input: people = [[7,0],[4,4],[7,1],[5,0],[6,1],[5,2]]
// Output: [[5,0],[7,0],[5,2],[6,1],[4,4],[7,1]]
// Explanation:
// Person 0 has height 5 with no other people taller or the same height in front.
// Person 1 has height 7 with no other people taller or the same height in front.
// Person 2 has height 5 with two persons taller or the same height in front, which is person 0 and 1.
// Person 3 has height 6 with one person taller or the same height in front, which is person 1.
// Person 4 has height 4 with four people taller or the same height in front, which are people 0, 1, 2, and 3.
// Person 5 has height 7 with one person taller or the same height in front, which is person 1.
// Hence [[5,0],[7,0],[5,2],[6,1],[4,4],[7,1]] is the reconstructed queue.
// Example 2:

// Input: people = [[6,0],[5,0],[4,0],[3,2],[2,2],[1,4]]
// Output: [[4,0],[5,0],[2,2],[3,2],[1,4],[6,0]]


// Constraints:

// 1 <= people.length <= 2000
// 0 <= hi <= 10^6
// 0 <= ki < people.length
// It is guaranteed that the queue can be reconstructed.

class Solution {
public:
    vector<vector<int>> reconstructQueue(vector<vector<int>>& people) {
        sort(people.begin(), people.end(), [](const vector<int>& u, vector<int>& v) {
            return u[0] < v[0] || (u[0] == v[0] && u[1] > v[1]);
        });
        int n = people.size();
        vector<vector<int>> res(n);
        for (const vector<int>& person: people) {
            int space = person[1] + 1;
            for (int i = 0; i < n; i ++) {
                if (res[i].empty()) {
                    space --;
                    if (!space) {
                        res[i] = person;
                        break;
                    }
                }
            }
        }
        return res;
    }
