@desc:
Given an integer n. No-Zero integer is a positive integer which doesn't contain any 0 in its decimal representation.

Return a list of two integers [A, B] where:

A and B are No-Zero integers.
A + B = n
It's guarateed that there is at least one valid solution. If there are many valid solutions you can return any of them.



Example 1:

Input: n = 2
Output: [1,1]
Explanation: A = 1, B = 1. A + B = n and both A and B don't contain any 0 in their decimal representation.
Example 2:

Input: n = 11
Output: [2,9]
Example 3:

Input: n = 10000
Output: [1,9999]
Example 4:

Input: n = 69
Output: [1,68]
Example 5:

Input: n = 1010
Output: [11,999]
