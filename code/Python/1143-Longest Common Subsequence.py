# Given two strings text1 and text2, return the length of their longest common subsequence. If there is no common subsequence, return 0.

# A subsequence of a string is a new string generated from the original string with some characters (can be none) deleted without changing the relative order of the remaining characters.

# For example, "ace" is a subsequence of "abcde".
# A common subsequence of two strings is a subsequence that is common to both strings.

 

# Example 1:

# Input: text1 = "abcde", text2 = "ace" 
# Output: 3  
# Explanation: The longest common subsequence is "ace" and its length is 3.
# Example 2:

# Input: text1 = "abc", text2 = "abc"
# Output: 3
# Explanation: The longest common subsequence is "abc" and its length is 3.
# Example 3:

# Input: text1 = "abc", text2 = "def"
# Output: 0
# Explanation: There is no such common subsequence, so the result is 0.
 

# Constraints:

# 1 <= text1.length, text2.length <= 1000
# text1 and text2 consist of only lowercase English characters.

# dp[i][j]表示text1[0:i]和text2[0:j]之间最大公共子串长度
# 更新的时候确定边界dp[0][j]和dp[i][0]都是0
# 当text1[i]==text2[j]时候dp[i + 1][j + 1] = dp[i][j] + 1，否增更新dp[i + 1][j]和dp[i][j + 1]之间较大值

                else:
                    dp[i][j] = max(dp[i - 1][j], dp[i][j - 1])
