# Given a linked list, reverse the nodes of a linked list k at a time and return its modified list.
#
# k is a positive integer and is less than or equal to the length of the linked list. If the number of nodes is not a multiple of k then left-out nodes in the end should remain as it is.
#
# Example:
#
# Given this linked list: 1->2->3->4->5
#
# For k = 2, you should return: 2->1->4->3->5
#
# For k = 3, you should return: 3->2->1->4->5
#
# Note:
#
# Only constant extra memory is allowed.
# You may not alter the values in the list's nodes, only nodes itself may be changed.

# Definition for singly-linked list.
