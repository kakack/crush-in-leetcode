# Given a binary tree, check whether it is a mirror of itself (ie, symmetric around its center).
#
# For example, this binary tree [1,2,2,3,4,4,3] is symmetric:
#
#     1
#    / \
#   2   2
#  / \ / \
# 3  4 4  3
# Â 
#
# But the following [1,2,2,null,3,null,3] is not:
#
#     1
#    / \
#   2   2
#    \   \
#    3    3
