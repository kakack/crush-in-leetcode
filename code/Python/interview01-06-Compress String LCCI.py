# Implement a method to perform basic string compression using the counts of repeated characters.
# For example, the string aabcccccaaa would become a2blc5a3.
# If the "compressed" string would not become smaller than the original string,
# your method should return the original string. You can assume the string has only uppercase and lowercase letters (a - z).
#
# Example 1:
# Input: "aabcccccaaa"
# Output: "a2b1c5a3"
#
# Example 2:
# Input: "abbccd"
# Output: "abbccd"
#
# Explanation:
# The compressed string is "a1b2c2d1", which is longer than the original string.
# Â 
#
# Note:
# 0 <= S.length <= 50000
