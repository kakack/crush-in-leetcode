@desc:
Given an array where elements are sorted in ascending order, convert it to a height balanced BST.

For this problem, a height-balanced binary tree is defined as a binary tree in which the depth of the two subtrees of every node never differ by more than 1.

Example:

Given the sorted array: [-10,-3,0,5,9],

One possible answer is: [0,-3,9,-10,null,5], which represents the following height balanced BST:

      0
     / \
   -3   9
   /   /
 -10  5

            root = TreeNode(nums[mid])
            root.left = helper(left, mid - 1)
            root.right = helper(mid + 1, right)

        return helper(0, len(nums) - 1)
