# Write a program to find the n-th ugly number.
#
# Ugly numbers are positive numbers whose prime factors only include 2, 3, 5.
#
# Example:
# Input: n = 10
# Output: 12
# Explanation: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, 10, 12 is the sequence of the first 10 ugly numbers.
#
# Note:
# - 1 is typically treated as an ugly number.
# - n does not exceed 1690.
