# Given two arrays arr1 and arr2, the elements of arr2 are distinct,
# and all elements in arr2 are also in arr1.
#
# Sort the elements of arr1 such that the relative ordering of items in arr1 are the same as in arr2. 
# Elements that don't appear in arr2 should be placed at the end of arr1 in ascending order.
#
# Example 1:
# Input: arr1 = [2,3,1,3,2,4,6,7,9,2,19], arr2 = [2,1,4,3,9,6]
# Output: [2,2,2,1,4,3,3,9,6,7,19]
#
# Constraints:
# - arr1.length, arr2.length <= 1000
# - 0 <= arr1[i], arr2[i] <= 1000
# - Each arr2[i] is distinct.
# - Each arr2[i] is in arr1.
