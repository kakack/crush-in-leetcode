@desc:
Given two strings s and t, return the number of distinct subsequences of s which equals t.

A string's subsequence is a new string formed from the original string by deleting some (can be none) of the characters without disturbing the remaining characters' relative positions. (i.e., "ACE" is a subsequence of "ABCDE" while "AEC" is not).

It is guaranteed the answer fits on a 32-bit signed integer.



Example 1:

Input: s = "rabbbit", t = "rabbit"
Output: 3
Explanation:
As shown below, there are 3 ways you can generate "rabbit" from S.
rabbbit
rabbbit
rabbbit
Example 2:

Input: s = "babgbag", t = "bag"
Output: 5
Explanation:
As shown below, there are 5 ways you can generate "bag" from S.
babgbag
babgbag
babgbag
babgbag
babgbag


Constraints:

0 <= s.length, t.length <= 1000
s and t consist of English letters.
