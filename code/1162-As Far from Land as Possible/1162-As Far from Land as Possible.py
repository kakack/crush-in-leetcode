# Given an N x N grid containing only values 0 and 1, where 0 represents water and 1 represents land, find a water cell such that its distance to the nearest land cell is maximized and return the distance.
#
# The distance used in this problem is the Manhattan distance: the distance between two cells (x0, y0) and (x1, y1) is |x0 - x1| + |y0 - y1|.
#
# If no land or water exists in the grid, return -1.
#
#
# Example 1:
# Input: [[1,0,1],[0,0,0],[1,0,1]]
# Output: 2
# Explanation:
# The cell (1, 1) is as far as possible from all the land with distance 2.
#
# Example 2:
# Input: [[1,0,0],[0,0,0],[0,0,0]]
# Output: 4
# Explanation:
# The cell (2, 2) is as far as possible from all the land with distance 4.
#  
#
# Note:
# - 1 <= grid.length == grid[0].length <= 100
# - grid[i][j] is 0 or 1
