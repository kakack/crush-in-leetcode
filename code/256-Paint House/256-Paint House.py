LeetCode 256 - Paint House

解题步骤（自动整理）
1. 定义状态（dp[i] 或 dp[i][j]）来表示子问题的最优解/可行性
2. 写出状态转移方程，并处理边界初始化
3. 按依赖顺序递推（必要时滚动数组优化空间），得到最终答案
"""
# There is a row of n houses, where each house can be painted one of three colors: red, blue, or green. The cost of painting each house with a certain color is different. You have to paint all the houses such that no two adjacent houses have the same color.

# The cost of painting each house with a certain color is represented by an n x 3 cost matrix costs.

# For example, costs[0][0] is the cost of painting house 0 with the color red; costs[1][2] is the cost of painting house 1 with color green, and so on...
# Return the minimum cost to paint all houses.

#

# Example 1:

# Input: costs = [[17,2,17],[16,16,5],[14,3,19]]
# Output: 10
# Explanation: Paint house 0 into blue, paint house 1 into green, paint house 2 into blue.
# Minimum cost: 2 + 5 + 3 = 10.
# Example 2:

# Input: costs = [[7,6,2]]
# Output: 2
#

# Constraints:

# costs.length == n
# costs[i].length == 3
# 1 <= n <= 100
# 1 <= costs[i][j] <= 20

class Solution:
    def minCost(self, costs: List[List[int]]) -> int:
        dp = costs[0]
        for i in range(1, len(costs)):
            dp = [min(dp[j - 1], dp[j - 2]) + c for j, c in enumerate(costs[i])]
        return min(dp)
