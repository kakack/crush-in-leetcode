# In an alien language, surprisingly they also use english lowercase letters, but possibly in a different order. The order of the alphabet is some permutation of lowercase letters.

# Given a sequence of words written in the alien language, and the order of the alphabet, return true if and only if the given words are sorted lexicographicaly in this alien language.

# Example 1:
# Input: words = ["hello","leetcode"], order = "hlabcdefgijkmnopqrstuvwxyz"
# Output: true
# Explanation: As 'h' comes before 'l' in this language, then the sequence is sorted.

# Example 2:
# Input: words = ["word","world","row"], order = "worldabcefghijkmnpqstuvxyz"
# Output: false
# Explanation: As 'd' comes after 'l' in this language, then words[0] > words[1], hence the sequence is unsorted.

# Example 3:
# Input: words = ["apple","app"], order = "abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz"
# Output: false
# Explanation: The first three characters "app" match, and the second string is shorter (in size.) According to lexicographical rules "apple" > "app", because 'l' > '∅', where '∅' is defined as the blank character which is less than any other character (More info).

# Constraints:

# 1 <= words.length <= 100
# 1 <= words[i].length <= 20
# order.length == 26
# All characters in words[i] and order are English lowercase letters.

            word2 = words[i+1]

            # Find the first difference word1[k] != word2[k].
            for k in range(min(len(word1), len(word2))):

                    if order_index[word1[k]] > order_index[word2[k]]:

                    break

                # words are like ("app", "apple").
