@file: 839-Similar String Groups.py
@time: 2021/1/31 10:35 下午
@desc:

Two strings X and Y are similar if we can swap two letters (in different positions) of X, so that it equals Y. Also two strings X and Y are similar if they are equal.

For example, "tars" and "rats" are similar (swapping at positions 0 and 2), and "rats" and "arts" are similar, but "star" is not similar to "tars", "rats", or "arts".

Together, these form two connected groups by similarity: {"tars", "rats", "arts"} and {"star"}.  Notice that "tars" and "arts" are in the same group even though they are not similar.  Formally, each group is such that a word is in the group if and only if it is similar to at least one other word in the group.

We are given a list strs of strings where every string in strs is an anagram of every other string in strs. How many groups are there?



Example 1:

Input: strs = ["tars","rats","arts","star"]
Output: 2
Example 2:

Input: strs = ["omv","ovm"]
Output: 1


Constraints:

1 <= strs.length <= 100
1 <= strs[i].length <= 1000
sum(strs[i].length) <= 2 * 104
strs[i] consists of lowercase letters only.
All words in strs have the same length and are anagrams of each other.
