LeetCode 547 - Number of Provinces

解题步骤（自动整理）
1. 用 DFS/回溯枚举所有可能选择，并维护当前路径/状态
2. 在递归过程中进行剪枝（如边界、重复、提前失败条件）
3. 到达终止条件时收集结果或返回，并回溯撤销选择

@desc:
There are n cities. Some of them are connected, while some are not. If city a is connected directly with city b, and city b is connected directly with city c, then city a is connected indirectly with city c.

A province is a group of directly or indirectly connected cities and no other cities outside of the group.

You are given an n x n matrix isConnected where isConnected[i][j] = 1 if the ith city and the jth city are directly connected, and isConnected[i][j] = 0 otherwise.

Return the total number of provinces.

Example 1:

Input: isConnected = [[1,1,0],[1,1,0],[0,0,1]]
Output: 2
Example 2:

Input: isConnected = [[1,0,0],[0,1,0],[0,0,1]]
Output: 3

Constraints:
1 <= n <= 200
n == isConnected.length
n == isConnected[i].length
isConnected[i][j] is 1 or 0.
isConnected[i][i] == 1
isConnected[i][j] == isConnected[j][i]
