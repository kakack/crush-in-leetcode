@desc:
Given the root of a Binary Search Tree (BST), return the minimum difference between the values of any two different nodes in the tree.

Note: This question is the same as 530: https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-absolute-difference-in-bst/



Example 1:


Input: root = [4,2,6,1,3]
Output: 1
Example 2:


Input: root = [1,0,48,null,null,12,49]
Output: 1


Constraints:

The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [2, 100].
0 <= Node.val <= 105
