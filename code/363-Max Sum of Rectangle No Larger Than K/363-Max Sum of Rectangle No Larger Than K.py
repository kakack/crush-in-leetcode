@file: 363-Max Sum of Rectangle No Larger Than K.py
@time: 2021/4/22 14:32
@desc:

Given an m x n matrix matrix and an integer k, return the max sum of a rectangle in the matrix such that its sum is no larger than k.

It is guaranteed that there will be a rectangle with a sum no larger than k.



Example 1:


Input: matrix = [[1,0,1],[0,-2,3]], k = 2
Output: 2
Explanation: Because the sum of the blue rectangle [[0, 1], [-2, 3]] is 2, and 2 is the max number no larger than k (k = 2).
Example 2:

Input: matrix = [[2,2,-1]], k = 3
Output: 3


Constraints:

m == matrix.length
n == matrix[i].length
1 <= m, n <= 100
-100 <= matrix[i][j] <= 100
-105 <= k <= 105


Follow up: What if the number of rows is much larger than the number of columns?
