# You are given a string s and an array of strings words of the same length. Return all starting indices of substring(s) in s that is a concatenation of each word in words exactly once, in any order, and without any intervening characters.

# You can return the answer in any order.

 

# Example 1:

# Input: s = "barfoothefoobarman", words = ["foo","bar"]
# Output: [0,9]
# Explanation: Substrings starting at index 0 and 9 are "barfoo" and "foobar" respectively.
# The output order does not matter, returning [9,0] is fine too.
# Example 2:

# Input: s = "wordgoodgoodgoodbestword", words = ["word","good","best","word"]
# Output: []
# Example 3:

# Input: s = "barfoofoobarthefoobarman", words = ["bar","foo","the"]
# Output: [6,9,12]
 

# Constraints:

# 1 <= s.length <= 104
# s consists of lower-case English letters.
# 1 <= words.length <= 5000
# 1 <= words[i].length <= 30
# words[i] consists of lower-case English letters.
