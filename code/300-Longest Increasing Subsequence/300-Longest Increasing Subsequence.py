# Given an integer array nums, return the length of the longest strictly increasing subsequence.

# A subsequence is a sequence that can be derived from an array by deleting some or no elements without changing the order of the remaining elements. For example, [3,6,2,7] is a subsequence of the array [0,3,1,6,2,2,7].

 

# Example 1:

# Input: nums = [10,9,2,5,3,7,101,18]
# Output: 4
# Explanation: The longest increasing subsequence is [2,3,7,101], therefore the length is 4.
# Example 2:

# Input: nums = [0,1,0,3,2,3]
# Output: 4
# Example 3:

# Input: nums = [7,7,7,7,7,7,7]
# Output: 1
 

# Constraints:

# 1 <= nums.length <= 2500
# -10^4 <= nums[i] <= 10^4
 

# Follow up: Can you come up with an algorithm that runs in O(n log(n)) time complexity?

# // f(n)=maxf(i)+1 其中 i<n 且 a[i]<a[n]

class Solution:
    def lengthOfLIS(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        n = len(nums)
        dp = [1] * n
        res = 1
        for i in range(1, n):
            for j in range(i):
                if nums[i] > nums[j]:
                    dp[i] = max(dp[i], dp[j] + 1)
                res = max(res, dp[i])
        return res
