LeetCode 583 - Delete Operation for Two Strings

解题步骤（自动整理）
1. 定义状态（dp[i] 或 dp[i][j]）来表示子问题的最优解/可行性
2. 写出状态转移方程，并处理边界初始化
3. 按依赖顺序递推（必要时滚动数组优化空间），得到最终答案
"""
# Given two strings word1 and word2, return the minimum number of steps required to make word1 and word2 the same.

# In one step, you can delete exactly one character in either string.



# Example 1:

# Input: word1 = "sea", word2 = "eat"
# Output: 2
# Explanation: You need one step to make "sea" to "ea" and another step to make "eat" to "ea".
# Example 2:

# Input: word1 = "leetcode", word2 = "etco"
# Output: 4


# Constraints:

# 1 <= word1.length, word2.length <= 500
# word1 and word2 consist of only lowercase English letters.

class Solution:
    def minDistance(self, word1: str, word2: str) -> int:
        m, n = len(word1), len(word2)
        dp = [[0] * (n + 1) for _ in range(m + 1)]
        for i in range(1, m + 1):
            for j in range(1, n + 1):
                if word1[i - 1] == word2[j - 1]:
                    dp[i][j] = dp[i - 1][j - 1] + 1
                else:
                    dp[i][j] = max(dp[i - 1][j], dp[i][j - 1])

        lcs = dp[m][n]
        return m - lcs + n - lcs
