# Alice plays the following game, loosely based on the card game "21".
#
# Alice starts with 0 points, and draws numbers while she has less than K points.  During each draw, she gains an integer number of points randomly from the range [1, W], where W is an integer.  Each draw is independent and the outcomes have equal probabilities.
#
# Alice stops drawing numbers when she gets K or more points.  What is the probability that she has N or less points?
#
# Example 1:
#
# Input: N = 10, K = 1, W = 10
# Output: 1.00000
# Explanation:  Alice gets a single card, then stops.
# Example 2:
#
# Input: N = 6, K = 1, W = 10
# Output: 0.60000
# Explanation:  Alice gets a single card, then stops.
# In 6 out of W = 10 possibilities, she is at or below N = 6 points.
# Example 3:
#
# Input: N = 21, K = 17, W = 10
# Output: 0.73278
# Note:
#
# 0 <= K <= N <= 10000
# 1 <= W <= 10000
# Answers will be accepted as correct if they are within 10^-5 of the correct answer.
